Useful when validating the overnight basal 
settings on an insulin pump for type 1 diabetics.

**Note**: When you feel your BG is going too low 
or too high during the test, you must abort and 
try again another time. This test only works when
you do not consume any carbs or take any insulin
after starting.

with boiled vegetables and low-fat meat without
sauce. (ensure dinner is low-fat and low-protein)
2. Give regular bolus for dinner
3. Measure BG two hours after dinner.
4. Do NOT eat anything else for the rest of the
evening
5. Test BG at midnight
6. Test BG at 03:00 AM
7. Test BG after waking up
8. The test is now complete
