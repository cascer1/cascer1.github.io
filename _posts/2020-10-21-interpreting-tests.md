**I am not a doctor.** The advice below is based on 
my own experience with diabetes. You should not 
use this to replace the advice of an endocrinologist. 
Always be critical of advice you read online, especially 
when it relates to your health.

## Introduction

I am active in an online diabetes support community. 
In there, people sometimes ask questions about why 
their blood glucose is consistently too high or too low.
This advice could help in answering this question.

I have experience with insulin pump treatments with Novorapid 
(Novolog) and Fiasp, as well as manual injections with a separate 
bolus (Novorapid, Fiasp) and basal (Lantus, Tresiba) insulins.

If you think your nighttime basal rate (especially when using a pump) 
might need to be adjusted. Consider checking out

**Always consult a doctor before changing your insulin dosages**

## Getting data

I believe that the most important factor in figuring out 
why your blood glucose level isn't doing what you want 
is testing, and doing so often. To form a useful picture 
of your glucose during the day, I recommend testing *at least* 
as follows:

* Test right after you wake up
* Test before every meal
* Test two hours after every meal
* Test before you go to bed

This should give you about eight data points per day. 

**Why is this useful?**

Testing before and after a meal helps show a picture of how the 
meal affects your blood glucose. Of course, this also depends 
on what you ate, but it should give you some information.

Testing before and after bed helps show you whether your basal 
insulin might be adjusted.

## Interpreting the data

**I am not a doctor**. Seriously, I won't stop saying this. 
Talk to a doctor before you adjust your insulin dosage.

After having tested according to the schedule I mentioned above 
for a few days (try at least a week), you can start interpreting 
the data.

Here are a few observations and what I think they might mean:

### Blood glucose consistently rises after a meal
If your blood glucose if always (or most of the time) higher after 
a meal than it was before, that might mean that you need more 
mealtime insulin. It might also mean that you are eating very 
fatty foods which take a longer time to digest. 

### Blood glucose consistently falls after a meal
If your blood glucose always goes down significantly after a meal, 
you are probably taking too much insulin. Adjusting your carb ratio 
so that you don't take as much insulin could be helpful.

### Blood glucose is always higher after bed than before
Your nighttime basal might be too low. If you go to bed 
a short time after eating, it might be related to carbs. Try 
eating earlier if this is the case.

### Blood glucose is always lower after bed than before
Your nighttime basal might be too high. 


## Notes

I always try to keep my insulin ratio around 30% basal and 70% bolus. 
This works well for me because it keeps my blood glucose stable when I 
don't eat, and allows me to accurately take insulin for meals and 
corrections. There are people who believe a ratio that more heavily 
favours basal insulin is better, and that's fine. Diabetes treatment 
varies wildly from person to person.

All mealtimes can have different carb ratios. There is no reason for 
why you should have the same carb ratio at different times of the day.
